# FSDKaggle2018-Audio-Classification
This repository is dedicated to the sound classification project completed as part of the ["COMP47650 - Deep Learning"](https://hub.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=MODULE&MODULE=COMP47650) module assignment at UCD in 2021. The project focuses on classifying sounds into 41 categories using the [FSDKaggle2018 dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/2552860).

After being dormant for several years, I've decided to make this repository public for educational purposes. Notably, this project diverges from its original inspiration, which was based on the [work of @Vishwa07 in Keras](https://github.com/Vishwa07/IndoorSoundClassificaition/tree/master). In this version, I have implemented the project using PyTorch.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to this educational project!

# DISCLAIMER
While I never completed the training due to the substantial time requirement, I acknowledge that the project could benefit from further refinement. At the time of development, I lacked the knowledge on saving training progress. If you decide to use or explore this repository and encounter any bugs, issues, or potential improvements, I encourage you to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly welcomed and appreciated!
